# weather-app

This is a coding test. Please use the develop branch for testing purposes. I have created the develop branch from the main branch. I have added an API key in WeatherAPIService, so there's no need to create a new one. If it doesn't work, please use this key for testing: 49a2bc68527676df7e07931e232f2c14.
